         <h2>Hi, I'm Jennifer Welsh</h2>
         <p>I bought my first crypto in 2008. The market had crashed, and my dad, a broker at the time, encouraged me to start.
            I loved buying crypto and watching them move. But I didn’t have a strategy, and I was terrible with money. So I ended up selling my crypto when I needed money.
            Had I held on to those early investments, I’d be sitting on a pile of money today. But I wasn’t thinking long-term. I have a lot of regrets about that.
            It wasn’t long before I fired my financial advisor. It was clear my accounts hadn’t been managed with my best interest in mind. And I realized I could manage my own portfolio.
            As I learned and invested more, I talked with friends about their views on investing.
            Time and again, people said the same thing: crypto trading is easy once you get the hang of it.
            So I started getting informative trying to get the hang of it lol.
            I got a lot of joy from demystifying the crypto market so my friends who failed to invest properly with me earlier could start investing too and making money without feeling intimidated.
            And with encouragement from those friends, and my husband, I started sharing my learnings about the crypto markrt more publicly.
            I'm no Warren Buffett. And I’m certainly not a financial advisor.
            I’m a regular person who loves investing. I believe everyone can and should participate in the crypto market. And you don’t need anyone to do it for you.
            If you want to earn/learn the basics of crypto investing, and you want to invest on your own, then you're in the right place. Hop on our trading pool and I will teach you to invest in crypto properly.</p>
