    <div class="speech" >
        <p>I bought my first crypto in 2008. The market had crashed, and my dad, a broker at the time, encouraged me to start.
            I loved buying crypto and watching them move. But I didn’t have a strategy, and I was terrible with money. So I ended up selling my crypto when I needed money.
            Had I held on to those early investments, I’d be sitting on a pile of money today. But I wasn’t thinking long-term. I have a lot of regrets about that.
            It wasn’t long before I fired my financial advisor. It was clear my accounts hadn’t been managed with my best interest in mind. And I realized I could manage my own portfolio.
            As I learned and invested more, I talked with friends about their views on investing <a href="html/aboutme.html">Read more</a>

            <h3>Megan Bowen</h3>
            <span class="specialp">CHIEF CUSTOMER OFFICER</span>
            <p>I have never really been that financially savvy and initially focused on paying off debt, enrolling in company sponsored 401k's and saving money as much as possible. This helped me realize that I had an opportunity to be way more proactive in managing my money for my future and throughout multiple coaching sessions was able to help guide me to learn more about investing and make some important moves for my future financial security and peace of mind. What I loved most about working with this team was that they didn't just tell me what to do but rather helped me think about investing in a way that was accessible to me, breaking down complex topics very simply and helping me think through and make the decisions that were right for me. Indeed a sounding board and an encouraging coach to help hold me accountable to make some changes that will very positively impact my future.</p></div>

        <h3>Anna Vatuone</h3>
        <span class="specialp">ENTREPRENEUR</span>
        <P>With thousands of dollars in credit card debt and student loans hanging over my head, I lacked the hope I needed to move forward. Jenn was the first person I confided in about financial situation. On our first clarity call, I cried. She met me with empathy and compassion and never made me feel judged. She shared her personal story with me and provided clear next steps for taking action on my financial goals. At the end of our call she told me, “You can do this.” And she said in such a way that I believed her. Well, I did do it. I’ve paid off almost $20,000 of credit card debt in less than six months and I am now embarking on the start of my investing journey. So would I recommend this trading pool to a friend? Absolutely. Run, don’t walk. Working with this team is the best way to take action on your goals and transform your relationship with money in a holistic, easy-to-mange way.</P></div>

        <h3>Keturah Bishop</h3>
        <span class="specialp">ENTREPRENEUR</span>
        <p>This pool explains crypto in a clear, down-to-earth, non-judgy way that is perfect for someone like me who has experienced a bit (ok - a lot) of avoidance when it comes to wrangling my money. With their guidance, I was able to make tangible progress in tackling my debt, along with a game plan for knocking out the rest of it. I've automated my monthly savings and I'm excited for the next step - investing! I now see this as something I can actually do. Thanks to this pool, I'm no longer lying awake at night worrying about my money. I have a short&long-term plan of action and feel 100% empowered to make it happen. So grateful!</p></div>

        <h3>Samantha Kelen</h3>
        <span class="specialp">CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER</span>
        <p>I chose to work with this team to get my financial life in order. they helped me figure out how to bucket my money into short, medium, and long-term goals, organize and simplify my accounts, and prioritize and automate my investments. They broke down complex concepts into simple language but never spoke down to me. They never judged me based on the dollars in my accounts or shamed me for past financial decisions. They helped me set reasonable and attainable goals for responsible saving that will also allow me to enjoy my life. It's well worth it.</p></div>
